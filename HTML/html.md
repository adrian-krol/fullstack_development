```<html>``` tag (angular brackets) is the root of an HTML document. It is the container of all other HTML elements.

##### How to start writing our first HTML structure?

Every HTML5 structure starts with ```<!DOCTYPE html>```declaration that is not a tag, it specifies the information to the browser about what type of document the browser should expect. After this we write our HTML script under ```<html>``` tag.

For our first structure check out <a href = "html_structure.html">html_structure</a>.

##### What is a head tag?

```html <head>``` tag contains meta data of the page like document title, styles, links, scripts etc.
