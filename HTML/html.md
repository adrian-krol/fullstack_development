Let's begin with basic understanding of HTML and answer some unwanted questions.

##### What is HTML?

It stands for HyperText Markup Language, and is used to design webpages.

##### What is a html tag?

`<html>` tag (angular brackets) is the root of an HTML document. It is the container of all other HTML elements.

##### How to start writing our first HTML structure?

Every HTML5 structure starts with `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration that is not a tag, it specifies the information to the browser about what type of document the browser should expect. After this we write our HTML script under `<html>` tag.

For our first structure check out <a href = "html_structure.html">html_structure</a>.

`<body>` tag contains the front-end data displayed onto our webpage.Example, 

- <a href = "html_paragraph.html">paragraph ` <p> `</a> tag
- <a href = "html_headings.html">heading </a> `<h1>-<h6>` tags
